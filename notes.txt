We cannot ignore the frightening increase at teens dropping out of society and feeling alienated. There are many reasons for this. Unfortunately the end result is the same; a cycle of emotional difficulties, strangement, drug and alcohol abuse and other dangerous behaviors. We have helped with counseling, helping them earn GEDâ€™s, and coaching them back into the mainstream of healthy society. Some of the graduates of this program have attained success vocationally & communally, & among them are people who have gone on to counsel others, as well as those who have achieved careers in education.
